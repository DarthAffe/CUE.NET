**CUE.NET is considered done now and will be no longer actively developed.   
It is superseded by [RGB.NET](https://github.com/DarthAffe/RGB.NET). Feel free to join the [discord-channel](https://discord.gg/9kytURv) if you're interested what's happening there :)**

# CUE.NET
C# (.NET) Wrapper library around the Corsair CUE-SDK

Please take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/DarthAffe/CUE.NET/wiki) or the documentation at [http://cue.wyrez.org](http://cue.wyrez.org) for some help on how to use the library. Documentation and Tutorials will be finished/rewritten soon.

Drop me a message if you need help, something is missing, behaves weird or doesn't feel good (from a programmer's point of view)!
