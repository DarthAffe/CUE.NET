Please take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/DarthAffe/CUE.NET/wiki) or the documentation at [http://cue.wyrez.org](http://cue.wyrez.org) for some help on how to use the library. Documentation and Tutorials will be finished/rewritten soon.

Drop me a message if you need help, something is missing, behaves weird or doesn't feel good (from a programmer's point of view)!
